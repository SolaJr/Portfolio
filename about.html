And with my minors in Project Management and Game Design and Development, I have supplemented my education to incorporate modern technology in my products and present them in simple, clean manners. <br/><br/>I have a keen eye for perfecting details from a consumer&#x27;s point of view and a solid understanding of technical restraints that come with developing products for modern consumers to help inform my design decisions.During my (seemingly scarce) free time, I can be seen writing screenplays for local film festivals and singing in kareoke joints(or anywhere honestly) with a Disney playlist. Please, don&#x27;t be afriad to reach out to me to ask any questions at OlusolaBabatunde.Sb@gmail.com .</p></div></div></div><div class="wrapper-info about"><h1>Why Product Designer </h1><p class="paragraph-3"><br/><br/>Growing up as the youngest sibling of 4 kids, I learned alot from each of my siblings successes and regrets. Eventually, I started learning how to predict potential causes of regret such as college debt or social isolation after witnessing them in my sibilings. <br/><br/>And even though I didn&#x27;t want to have similar regrets, I used to think their was nothing I could do about. That was until I was introduced to the world of programming and tech. I learned that whenever I was facing a problem I couldn&#x27;t get past, I could probably build some kind of solution to get past it without feeling regret. And at the time my biggest regret in high school were my grades. <br/><br/>I regularly began programming apps to do things like solve chemistry equations for homework or calculate potential GPAs for myself so that I could avoid regretting all the time I spent on homework and dedicate more time to studying for exams. Eventually my friends learned about my little projects and asked if I could help them build GPA calculators and Scholarship Tracker programs. <br/><br/>Now what got me into product design wasn&#x27;t just sharing programs with people (after all,I already developed the program so I had nothing to lose) but it was taking people&#x27;s feedback and reviews and using them to develop a newer, improved product. <br/>‍<br/>The amount of joy on their faces when I delivered it was indescribable and matched only by my excitement towards completing a new renovation or design. This eventually lead me to develop apps to assist people in my community. Products like Scholar Fish(an app that helps students automatically apply for scholarships) and VestaGoGo (an app that assist visually impaired students with navigation) are prime examples of programs designed to help people in my community be more connected to information in ways that I could have never predicted. <br/><br/>At this point I knew I wanted to work in design since product designers and design engineers get to touch and help every facet of the product development lifespan. And the process of continuing to learn in an ever changing industry would be perfect for teaching me how to help people solve more of their problems in the future. <br/><br/>The reason I prefer product design over design engineering is mainly because of all the learning opportunities involved in product design. I like how encouraging companies can be for me to continue learning by attending tech conferences and hackathons.
